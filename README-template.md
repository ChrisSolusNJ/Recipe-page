## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned more about using flexbox, however I would like to improve more in responsive design and CSS layout.

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my CSS page styling, learn more about using Flexbox and CSS Grid, and how to use responsive design properly.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox) - It helped me understand some flexbox rules
- [Aprende CSS Flexbox](Aprendem) - It helped me better understand the usefulness of flexbox and how to apply it.
